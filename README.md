Problem Statement 6: "Disjoint Set ADT and Self-Organising List"

Welcome to our group project repository. This project focuses on designing and implementing two important data structures: "Disjoint Set" and "Self-Organising List".

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of Disjoint Set ADT and Self-Organizing List in C/C++. Both data structures are fundamental in computer science and have various applications in different domains

## Contents

- `disjoint_set.cpp`: Implementation of Disjoint Set ADT.
- `self_organising_list.cpp`: Implementation of Self-Organizing List.
- `Self Organising List.txt`: Explanation for the use of "move to front" in SOL
- `Disjoint_set.pdf`: Explanation for the use of "trees" and "union by rank" in Disjoint Set
- `Self Organizing List - Test_cases.pdf`: Implementation of Functional testing by reviewing test cases.[Self Organising List]
- `Disjoint Set Test Cases`: Implementation of Functional testing by reviewing test cases.[Disjoint Set ADT]
