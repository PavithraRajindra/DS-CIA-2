## ## Disjoint Set ADT
The implementation of disjoint-set data structure using trees, particularly with the union by rank method, offers several advantages over other data structures like arrays

## Efficient Union and Find Operations 
  -In a tree-based implementation, the union operation is typically faster compared to array-based implementations. 
  -By linking smaller trees to larger ones based on their rank, the height of trees is kept low, resulting in faster find operations as well.

## Balanced Trees 
  -Union by rank ensures that the resulting trees remain balanced. 
  -Balanced trees prevent degenerate cases where the tree becomes essentially a linked list, ensuring that find operations remain efficient even in worst-case scenarios.

## Optimized Find Operation 
  -The find operation in a tree-based disjoint-set structure has a time complexity of O(log n) in the worst case, where n is the number of elements. 
   -This is because path compression is applied during the find operation, which flattens the tree structure, reducing the height of the tree.

## Memory Efficiency
  -Tree-based implementations typically require less memory compared to array-based implementations, especially when dealing with large sets of elements. 
  -This is because only the parent pointer, rank, and possibly some additional metadata are stored for each element, rather than allocating memory for an entire array.

## Scalability
  -Tree-based implementations scale well with the number of elements in the disjoint sets. 
  -Even for large sets of elements, the time complexity of union and find operations remains logarithmic, making tree-based implementations suitable for a wide range of applications.

## Flexibility 
  -Tree-based disjoint-set implementations offer flexibility in terms of the underlying data structure. 
  -Different variations, such as using path compression or weighted union, can be applied based on the specific requirements of the application.

Overall, tree-based implementations with union by rank strike a balance between efficiency, memory usage, and scalability, making them a popular choice for implementing disjoint-set data structures in various algorithms and applications.
